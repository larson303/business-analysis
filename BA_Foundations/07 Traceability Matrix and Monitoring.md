## Traceability Approach
- Thinking about how requirements are related and tracking them
	- Ensuring direct connection between

- This is how you use the Traceability Approach
- Tool used to track a project and serve as a home for all needed documentation
	- May link to other documentation such as:
		- Use Cases
		- Analysis Models
		- Design Documents
		- Test
			- Plans
			- Cases
			- Results
		- Acceptance Sign-Offs
- Columns with Titles that represent the status of a requirement
	- Examples include
		- To Do
		- In Progress [Can be further subdivided]

Just as people get satisfaction from knowing when an online order will be delivered or when a ride share will arrive, as well as if there are disruptions:

- Requirements should be traced so that stakeholders know when they will be delivered and approved.
	- This is accomplished using a traceability matrix.

## Traceability Approach
- Thinking about how requirements are related and tracking them
	- Ensuring direct connection between 
		- requirements and 
		- the supporting objective and artifacts
- Allows for tracking progress on individual requirements
- Exposes obstacles that are preventing progress

# Traceability Matrix and Task Board
## Traceability Matrix

**The Traceability Matrix should act as a single source to connect all project requirement documentation:
- **It Should be able to assess the impact of changes to requirements**
- Overall Project Scope
- Allows Changes to be assessed and quantified from the perspectives of 
	- cost
	- time
	- priority
	- risk
- Primary Source of 
	- Tracking Efforts
	- Improving Communication
	- Clarifying progress

- This is how you use the Traceability Approach
- Tool used to track a project and serve as a home for all needed documentation
	- May link to other documentation such as:
		- Use Cases
		- Analysis Models
		- Design Documents
		- Test
			- Plans
			- Cases
			- Results
		- Acceptance Sign-Offs
- Columns with Titles that represent the status of a requirement
	- Examples include
		- To Do
		- In Progress [Can be further subdivided]
			- Analysis
			- Design
			- Development
			- Test
		- Done
- A Detailed Traceability matrix may include Road Maps, Features, and Epics that drill down to user stories
	- Can connect each requirement to the corresponding business and project objectives
- 


# Change Control

- Change happens all the time
	- It is happening faster 
	- It is happening more often?

## The Critical Role of the BA

- How well a company deals with change is a strong indictor of their long-term stability in the face of disruptive technologies.

### Configuration Control:
- Tracking of Changes to documents or processes via version control

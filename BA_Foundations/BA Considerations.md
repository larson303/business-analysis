- We can focus on 
	- "AI Transformation"
	- Langchain -> Creating chatbot frontends
		- Tying Models together
		- e.g. 
			- 1. Scrape Websites for HR
			- 2. Summary Analysis / Sentiment Analysis
			- 3. Chatbot
			- 3. UI:   People can access the chatbot to get instant information
				- sample "How much is my per-diem"
					- vary by department or staff level



- Disconnect between UI -> Figma -> React -> *transition* from VM to the MV (API)
	- e.g. MVC - Model View Controller
	- MVVM - Backend creates Model View then point to the front-end for the View Model
		- Domain Model is the API   - creates Model View (Domain-Driven Design)
		- Dump the View Model into the Reactive front end.

- All the hard work on the project culminates in a release.

#### Release - The product, service, result, or solution being delivered to the client at a specified time.
- The What
- The When
- The piece of work and what has been accepted


# Project Release Planning
- Happens on a high level with the roadmap about what will be delivered when
- Selection of User Stories
- Planning of Sprints

- Can the result be delivered in Stages?
- The nature of the receiver will affect how we deliver things
	- e.g. minor change for accounting
	- v.s. moving technology to the cloud

## Sprint Planning

### Release Planning:  The What and When
#### Prioritize which changes come first and are most important
- Create a hierarchy of requirements prioritized according to
	- Feasibility
	- Value
- Items are then prioritized within the next planned release
- Do the big rocks first

# Project Transition Planning

## Transition Plan: The How
- Organized set of details on how the solution will be implemented in the organization
	- Is there training involved?
	- Is there a data conversion?
	- Ensures the success of the product
- Pilot Programming - Rolling it out to a few customers first
	- Test Market
	- May need old and new to run simultaneously until validation can be completed.
- Big Bang
	- Old is replaced by the new
	- Requires a lot of testing and no going back
	- Train prior to release of the feature or product
	- May need to record the new training for late comers
- Put yourself in the shoes of the customer


# Solution Implementation and Planning
- It falls upon the BA to ensure the new solution is used and meets the original expectations
	- Especially if there was a major change
	- It can meet with resistance
	- The acceptance of the change needs to be continually evaluated
- May need to identify future needs after implementation
- Internal Support of the Application
	- Application Support
	- Application Training
	- Customer Service Support

#### It is important to ensure that monitoring of customer adoption achieved the expected outcome or that the value of the result is tracked.
- Was their increased feature adoption?
- What was the rate of the adoption?
- What were the hinderances to adoption?

3. Implementation planning activities include all of the following EXCEPT:
	- activities for tracking usage of the solution
	- shadowing to ensure acceptance of solution
	- finalizing payments and shutting down funding
		- Often, during the implementation phase more funding is required to ensure the successful implementation of the solution. If you withdraw funding, all your work may go to waste at the final stage.

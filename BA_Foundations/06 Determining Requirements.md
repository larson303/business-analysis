Requirements = What we need to do to satisfy the customer
but
What the customer puts into the requirements isn't necessarily what we are going to do
- It is a wish list that gives us a direction

- Requirements come in different formats
- Control the Scope

# Requirement Types

**Regardless of the requirement type, it is important to define how requirements will be managed and tracked**

### 1. Business Requirements
- Represent the higher level needs of the organization
	- Identified through the needs assessment process
		- either needs or opportunities
	- Reason for project selection and justification

### 2. Stakeholder Requirements
- Individual or group needs
	- Internal 
	- External
		- Customers
		- Suppliers
		- Partners
		- Compliance Requirements
### 3. Solution Requirements
- Features, functions, characteristics of a result
	- (What the customer wants at the end of the work)
- Functional Requirements
	- What the user will be able to do or what they will receive when they are done
- Non-Functional Requirements
	- Environmental or quality of service conditions such as 
		- technology requirements
		- security requirements
### 4. Transition Requirements
- Activities required to move from the current to the desired future state
	- Training
	- Documentation
	- Possibly
		- Conversion Requirements
			- Implementation Requirements
### 5. Project Requirements (Requirements of Project Manager)
- Specified in agreements or internal procedures
	- Include processes and deliverables needed to complete the project on time
		- May Include management reviews
		- Status Updates
		- Performance Reports
### 6. Quality Requirements (Quality Analyst's Responsibility)
- Includes conditions or capabilities used to assess conformance to requirements


# Requirements Elicitation

- Several approaches
- Customize to each situation

## Elicitation Techniques

### Facilitated sessions
Best for sensitive information or from high-level members

- Goals
	- Guide Conversation
	- Prompts Brainstorming
	- Ensures session fulfills its goal
- Great for:
	- Can be used throughout the project and can be iterative
	- Brings cross-functional participants together
		- Having diverse participants naturally uncovers 
			- gaps
			- redundancies
			- needs
			- other important information
	- Better Communication, relationships, and consensus
- Approaches:
	- Interview Techniques and Styles
		- Highly Structured with pre-defined questions
		- Semi-Structured with some prepared questions and follow up
		- Unstructured with natural conversation
- 

### Collect and Analyze Existing Documentation
Need to ask why certain information even exists
- "Because it has always been done that way" is not a valid response
- Have Stakeholders take existing documentation and indicate whether they actually use it or not.
- Shadow people in their environment while performing duties
### Questionnaires and Surveys
- Open-ended questions 
	- Pro: obtain more detailed responses 
	- Con: Require more time to consolidate
### Beware of paralysis-analysis.  Constrain to 2-Phases
- Initial Elicitation during needs assessment activities
- Second discovery after the project has been initiated

## Choosing Elicitation Techniques:
- Type of Project and Approach
- Time and budget constraints
- Number and Location of Stakeholders
- Requirements of documentation type and detail


# Using Requirements Modeling

- BA is important for not just discovering requirements but also analyzing them.
## Models For Analyzing Requirements

- Nouns (data modeling)
- Verbs (process Modeling)
- Rules (business rule modeling)

#### Example Requirement
- I, as a customer, want to order a camera, to take photos of my family.
	- noun: camera
	- verb: to order
	- Unspoken rules
### Models to break the requirements down:
- Process (verbs) for Process Modeling
- Data Modeling (nouns)
#### First:  Process Modeling (verbs)
- Create the Process model first to understand the various steps required by looking for verbs
	- Have a face to face discussion with stakeholders at a white board
		- Take notes, sketch drawings, capture the discussion.
	- Start by drawing out the order in which things happen
		- Order Camera
		- Receive Camera
		- Use Camera
#### Second: Data Modeling (nouns)
- Cameras, Customers
	- What type of cameras?
	- What type of customers
#### Third: Business Rules Modeling
- Nouns and verbs are the foundations of the rules by determining how they interact
	- Relationships
	- Differences
- Use physical representations
- User Color 
	- types of people
	- types of cameras
- Then model with the stakeholder present
#### Fourth:  Bringing it all together (the real value)
- This is the real value is when all the analysis is combined to have a complete set of requirements.

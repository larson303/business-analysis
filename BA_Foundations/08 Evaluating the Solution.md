# Testing and Verifying the Requirements

## Verification Best Practices

1. Continuously collaborate with stakeholders
	1. Ensure that the requirements properly represent the needs of the stakeholders
2. Provide detail for solution creators
	1. Ensure appropriate detail and acceptance criteria have been gathered
3. Define procedures as part of quality management
	1. Often defined as part of the development methodology
4. Record the results of testing in the traceability matrix
	1. Link to the test scripts
	2. Link to the documentation
	3. Link to the test data

### Predictive approach
- Verification is often performed as part of a formal review of a requirements specification document

### Adaptive Approach
- Verification through collaborative conversations 
	- Possibly modeling activities between 
		- stakeholder
		- BA
		- implementation team member


### How much to test?
- Cost of Quality needs to be evaluated as part of the analysis to predetermine acceptable levels of Quality performance as part of quality control standards
	- Conformance
- Law of diminishing returns


# Validating the Requirements

**Requirement validation is the final step of the result.** 
- This usually means verification by the stakeholder that the outcome requested has been delivered.

### Verification:
- This is a continuous process of working with the stakeholders to ensure that the deliverables are going to meet the needs of the client.  

### Agile Verification:

- If delivery requires aiming for a target that is constantly moving, then there was not enough requirements analysis up front.  

- 

### How to Validate
- Validation includes:
	- Requirement Verification =  Acceptance Criteria
		- Checking conformance to the specifications that were provided.

	- Client Verification = Meeting the needs of the stakeholder 
		- User Acceptance
### How to Develop Validation 

- The course recommends that requirement validation should be an ongoing process that is happening as the developer is working on the feature requested.
- Continuous Discussion between the BA, Developer, and Stakeholder:
	- Question:  Do you agree or disagree that requirement should be constantly changing as the work is being done?
	- I personally disagree and here is why:

	- A user story or task should only proceed to development after the stakeholder has provided enough information to ensure that standards for requirements can be reasonably met.  
	- Analogy:  A restaurant wants to ensure that the customer gets what they want in the order.  When you go to a drive restaurant, they often have sign-boards that indicate the order that you are requesting, and clearly displays the order total.
	- When you go to pay for your order, they once again confirm your order contents and the price.  Conflict only occurs when either the contents or the price do not match what was originally requested.
	
		- A customer is free to add or change the contents of the order prior to paying; however, there is an adjustment in price, as well as an adjustment in time.  The customer will often be asked to park off to the side while other customers are served their order.
		- Unfortunately in software, this process is less mature in many companies.  Stakeholders will want to change the scope or priority of work after it has been started and instead of treating development resources with the same respect that a fast food restaurant would get, developers are often tasked with changing the order, without an adjustment in deadlines.
	
			- If you go to the same restaurant and repeatedly change your order, will you be treated with respect?
			- If you constantly blame the restaurant staff for not meeting your needs, will you be respected?
				- I challenge Chief Technology Officers to show me your dashboard that is tracking the number of times that requirements were changed to a feature after development was started, as well as who requested the change.  This dashboard should be by Product, and by Project, preferably as part of your corporate competency model that is tracking total cost of ownership by feature.
				


#### Responsibility Matrix: RACI Format
Approving Stakeholder Required for Each Requirement
- R - Responsible
- A - Accountable
- C - Consulted
- I - Informed
### The Traceability Matrix becomes the key tool to ensure all requirements are completed and accepted.

# Section 8 Quiz

1. Verification and testing of requirements `_____`
	- is equivalent to stakeholder approval
	- is the sole responsibility of the business analyst
	- are done continually as the business analyst reviews the requirements with stakeholders
		- Verification of requirements is done to make sure that the requirements were correctly understood prior to development--and then as part of testing to make sure that the development of the requirements met specifications.
	- is the sole responsibility of the development team, not the business analyst

2. What is the ultimate purpose of validation?
	- to ensure that the result is deployable
	- to ensure that deadlines are being met
	- to ensure that the result meets the acceptance criteria and the needs of the stakeholders
		- Validation ensures that the needs have been meet.
	- to ensure conformance to the provided specifications

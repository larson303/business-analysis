# Program vs Product vs Project

- This was a crucial differentiation for me.  As both a lead and a manager, I was part of a platform team that delivered business intelligence application for multiple departments.  When I started looking for work, I had been limiting myself to searching for the title of 'Software Manager' even though I was responsible for multiple teams, product, and projects.  I don't think the industry is well organized enough that companies make correct distinctions between different roles unless they are a very large organization that is well-funded enough to distinctly limit the job responsibilities of the employee to be focused on a subset of the solutions being delivered.

# Program Scope

1. **Definition**:
    - A **program scope** refers to the collective set of projects, initiatives, and related activities that are managed together to achieve strategic objectives.
    - It encompasses a group of interrelated projects or initiatives that share common goals, resources, and governance.
    - Programs are typically broader in scope than individual projects and focus on achieving long-term organizational benefits.
2. **Characteristics of Program Scope**:
    - **Strategic Alignment**: Programs align with an organization’s strategic vision and goals.
    - **Interdependencies**: Projects within a program are interconnected and rely on each other.
    - **Resource Sharing**: Programs often share resources (such as personnel, budget, and technology) across projects.
    - **Governance**: Programs have their own governance structure to oversee project execution.
    - **Benefits Realization**: The ultimate goal of a program is to deliver benefits that contribute to the organization’s success.
3. **Example**:
    - Imagine a large technology company launching a program called “Digital Transformation.”
    - Within this program, several projects are initiated:
        - Project A: Implementing cloud infrastructure.
        - Project B: Developing a customer portal.
        - Project C: Enhancing cybersecurity measures.
    - The program scope includes all these projects, ensuring they work together to achieve the company’s strategic goal of becoming a digitally advanced organization.

# Project Scope:

- **Definition**: Project scope refers to the work required to deliver a product or service.
    - **Components**: It encompasses various aspects such as assembly lines, budgets, staff training, supply chains, and personnel allocations.
    - **Focus**: Project scope concentrates on the tasks and steps needed to arrange the production or implementation of a good or service.
    - **Example**: Imagine a manager tasked with setting up a new data center. [The project scope would involve corresponding with contractors, acquiring physical components (computers, servers, office space), providing project documents, and establishing budgets and timeframes for final delivery](https://www.villanovau.com/articles/project-management/product-scope-vs-project-scope/)[1](https://www.villanovau.com/articles/project-management/product-scope-vs-project-scope/).

# Product Scope:
- **Definition**: Product scope pertains to the features or characteristics of the actual tangible product or service.
    - **Details**: It includes design, functionality, and component parts.
    - **Focus**: Product scope answers questions about how the product works, how it is physically made, and how it can be improved in future iterations.
    - [**Example**: In the case of the data center mentioned earlier, the product scope would encompass details like the computers, servers, network connectivity, and requisite software that constitute the data center itself](https://www.villanovau.com/articles/project-management/product-scope-vs-project-scope/)[1](https://www.villanovau.com/articles/project-management/product-scope-vs-project-scope/).


# Difference Between Project Scope and Product Scope:
    
- **Orientation**:
        - Project scope is oriented toward the **“how”** (work-related tasks).
        - Product scope is oriented toward the **“what”** (functional requirements).
    - **Interdependence**:
        - Project scope and product scope are interconnected. You can’t consider product deliverables (product scope) without understanding the tasks or steps needed to reach that point (project scope).

# Business Analysis and Business Analytics

## Problem Statement

- I noted the book I wrote `AI and the Future of Business Software Management`
that there are major inefficiencies with how large companies are currently 
managing technology.  Fundamentally, most C-Suite executives are working on a 
cash in/cash out mindset to monitor profitability with no metrics accounting
for the performance of the resources being used including manager effectiveness.
change control, developer value, code value, and capability models to ensure
 that problems are not being addressed multiple times.

 - As part of wanting to be part of the solution, a role in business analysis 
 and business analytics will put me in a position to evangelize solutions to 
 c-suite executives on how to align company strategic goals with change effort
that move companies towards maturity in adopting AI - Transformation.


## Qualifications

- Once considered an annoyance, now I perceive to be a super-power is that I
did not follow the traditional track of performing the same role in IT for
several years.  Most developers I know who ended up in management grew tired
of writing the same code year after year, so decided to challenge themselves 
by stepping into management.  In my career I have more roles than most people
I have ever met in IT.  Ironically, I found it frustrating at the time, but
I believe it has also uniquely positioned me to be knowledgeable about how to
create technology roadmaps, lead teams, and drive innovation across the technology 
stack just in time for the AI revolution.  My goal is to help companies drive
AI-Adoption with as much efficiency as possible.
